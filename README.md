## About the project
This is a web app with one frontend (web) and a backend writed using python. The backend is a RESTFul API and was made to be consumed by multiple clients.

The purpose of the app was to make a functional clone of Curriculum Lattes, with all its features and a prettier and simpler interface. Currently, Vitae supports 50% of Lattes's
profile information, but server code architecture built on [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) principles allows 
to add new profile information in a scalable and simple way.

### Features
- User authentication (JWT);
- Profile photo (file upload);
- Resume information:
  - Personal and contact information;
  - Academic and complementary education;
  - Professional experience;
  - Projects participation;
  - Productions published;
  
### This project improved my knowledge of:
- [CORS](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing#:~:text=Cross-Origin%20Resource%20Sharing%20ou,o%20recurso%20que%20ser√°%20recuperado.);
- [RESTFul patterns](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST);
- Flask;
- SQLAlchemy ORM and database configuration;
- Python virtual environments;
- React, JSX and javascript;
- JSON Web Token authentication;
- Responsive CSS;
  
I learned a lot with this project and the knowledge acquired here was used and improved on all the other upcoming projects that use these technologies and base concepts.

## Built with
- **Flask** - RESTFul API
- **SQLite** - Database
- **SQLAlchemy** - ORM
- **React** - Frontend web
